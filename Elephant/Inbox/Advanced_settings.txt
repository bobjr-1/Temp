Elephant has a number of settings stored in JSON format in your home directory, in file ".com.pinktwins.elephant.settings".

Some of these settings are not exposed in Elephant's UI. Use any text editor to apply these settings:

{
    "fontScale": 1.0,

Make all fonts smaller/bigger. Does not affect layout so scaling too much will negatively affect appearance. Yet, scaling slightly can be helpful with high-res screens.

    "pastePlaintext": true,

When true, any text is pasted in plain text. Default is false.

    "autoBullet": 0,

Whether to automatically create lists when starting a line with * - or +
Default is 1 (for true).

    "confirmDeleteFromTrash": true,

Confirm when deleting a note from Trash. Default is true.

    "allowFilenameChars": "öäåÖÄÅ",

Additional characters allowed in note's filename. The filename is based on note's title, and by default only a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and . - are allowed, other chars are converted to _.

    "useLucene": 0,

Use Lucene for search indexing. 1 to enable, 0 to disable. Default is to use lucene when note count exceeds 2000 notes.
When lucene is disabled, a simple in-memory structure is used for searching. You should not need to care about this.

}

Disabling note preview in Note List

Create an empty file called ".disablePreview" in a notebook folder to disable note preview in Note List.
This is useful with notebooks containing passwords, for example - the preview will not give away the note contents.
